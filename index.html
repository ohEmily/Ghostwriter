	<h2>Ghostwriter</h2>

	<p>Ghostwriter is an inexpensive, portable printer that can be disassembled and transported. It doesn’t require expensive ink cartridges -- instead, it uses standard pens to print with. Ghostwriter’s writing mechanism is modeled after the extruder on a 3D printer: it uses a frame that drags the pen across the page in the x and y directions as well as supporting an up and down motion to move the pen on and off the page. Ghostwriter uses Bluetooth technology to connect to computers or mobile phones to get documents to print.</p>
