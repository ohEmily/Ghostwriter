	<p>Ghostwriter is an inexpensive, portable printer that can be disassembled and transported. It doesn&apos;t require expensive ink cartridges -- instead, it uses standard pens to print with. Ghostwriter&apos;s writing mechanism is modeled after the extruder on a 3D printer: it uses a frame that drags the pen across the page in the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> directions as well as supporting an up and down motion to move the pen on and off the page.</p>
